# MExCoLib.js Monadic Experiment Combinator Library for JavaScript

This is a quarter-baked (not even half-baked) rendition at an experimentation
combinator framework/library in monadic form (because jargon!).

Part of being quarter-baked is fuck-all documentation... but I do have a few
comments in the code itself and a toy example at the tail... user beware:
this code bites.
